## � CONCLUSION

**The CSV configuration and DHIS2 sections are now PERFECTLY ALIGNED.**

You have successfully:
1. Removed the leading space from `FACILITY-SCREENING ROOM`
2. Renamed `SPECIMEN ROOM` to `SPECIMEN RECEPTION ROOM`
3. Renamed `LAB SERVICES PROVIDED` to `LABORATORY TESTING AREAS CHEMISTRY`
4. Renamed `X-RAY ROOM` to `LABORATORY TESTING AREAS HAEMATOLOGY`
5. Renamed `ULTRASOUND ROOM` to `MICROBIOLOGY`

The app should now correctly filter and display all service departments for all facility types, including the new Laboratory sections!
