# Hardcoded Facility Service Departments Demo

## What We've Implemented

‚úÖ **Replaced dynamic department generation with hardcoded mapping**
‚úÖ **11 specializations with tailored department lists**
‚úÖ **40 total possible departments to choose from**
‚úÖ **Clean, maintainable configuration**

## How It Works

### Before (Dynamic - Unpredictable)
```javascript
// Complex logic trying to guess departments from sections
const departments = sections
  .filter(section => shouldShowSection(section, specialization))
  .map(section => section.displayName)
  .filter(name => shouldShowDataElementForService(name, specialization))
// Result: Inconsistent, hard to predict, difficult to maintain
```

### After (Hardcoded - Predictable)
```javascript
// Simple, explicit mapping
const departments = getDepartmentsForSpecialization('Laboratory');
// Result: [
//   'ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT',
//   'STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS', 
//   'POLICIES AND PROCEDURES',
//   'SERVICE PROVIDED',
//   'PERSONNEL',
//   'ENVIRONMENT',
//   'LABORATORY WORK AREA',
//   'SAFETY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT',
//   'SUPPLIES',
//   'RECORDS/ INFORMATION MANAGEMENT',
//   'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION',
//   // ... 5 more departments
// ]
```

## Specialization Examples

| Specialization | Departments | Key Specialized Areas |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Hospital** | 31 | Emergency Room, Operating Theatre, ICU, Maternity Ward |
| **Laboratory** | 16 | Laboratory Work Area, specialized safety protocols |
| **Radiology** | 17 | X-Ray Room, Radiology Reading Room, radiation safety |
| **Dental** | 25 | Dental Chair Area, specialized infection control |
| **Eye** | 25 | Ophthalmology Examination Room, specialized equipment |
| **Clinic** | 24 | General clinical areas, basic procedures |

## Benefits

1. **üéØ Predictable**: Always know exactly which departments are available
2. **üîß Maintainable**: Easy to add/remove departments for any specialization
3. **‚ö° Fast**: No complex filtering logic, just simple array lookup
4. **üêõ Debuggable**: Clear mapping makes troubleshooting easy
5. **üë• User-Friendly**: Consistent experience across all specializations

## Usage in the App

When a user selects a specialization like "Laboratory", the Facility Service Departments field now shows exactly 16 relevant departments instead of trying to dynamically calculate them from complex section filtering rules.

The field shows:
- Current specialization name
- Number of available departments (e.g., "16/40 departments")
- Clean, predictable list of departments to select from
- Multi-select functionality with visual feedback

This approach eliminates the guesswork and provides a much better user experience!
